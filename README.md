# Projects in Python
This repository contains examples of the learning projects I completed while working on the Master of Science in Data Science degree at the Regis University.

The Jupyter notebooks and corresponding data files presenting data collection and wrangling examples in python could be found in the __Data_Collection_and_Preparation_Examples__  folder. 

The __EnergyEfficiencyProject__ folder presents a small project analyzing the results of a simulated study exploring links between energy efficiency and major buildings characteristics. 

The __IntegerProgramming__ folder includes examples of mathematical variables optimization used to make business decisions. 

The use of various natural language processing tools and techniques is demonstrated in the __TextAnalytics__ folder, including text processing, part of speech tagging, n-grams, collocation,  text similarity analysis, text classification, and text clustering approaches.   
The project presented in the __TwitterSentimentAnalysis__ folder applies text analytics tools to collecting, processing and analyzing tweets discussing car accidents posted by users in Denver, CO. 

All exercises and projects use open datasets specified in the corresponding notebook files.
